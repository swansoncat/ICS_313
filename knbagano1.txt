;;;;This file contains my answer to part 3 of assignment 1, in which we were asked about the two
;;;;modes for the ftp and sftp protocols.

The two modes provided by ftp and sftp are binary and ASCII mode. In Binary transfer mode a file is 
transferred to the new computer exactly byte for byte as it was on the old one. This may be a issue
if you're sending a text file between computers with different operating systems because different
operating systems encode special characters like line breaks differently. In ASCII mode, ftp and
sftp converts the special characters when transferring the text files between computers with
different operating systems. So for most files they would be sent in Binary mode but things like text
files, scripts, html files, etc., would be sent via the ASCII mode.
